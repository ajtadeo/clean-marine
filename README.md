# Clean Marine

## About

Our web app seeks to centralize information about local beach clean up events for those that wish to voluneer. We built Clean Marine using the Django full-stack Webframework to host our SQL database and web server, wrote webscraping scripts using Selenium and Beautiful Soup, and using the Google Maps API to provide users a visual guide on locating nearby events.

In the future, we'd like to integrate more volunteer organizations in our web scraper scripts and create a filtering tool for users to view events from certain organizations or within a certain distance. Additionally, we'd like to display the locations of each event listed on Clean Marine in the Google Maps component.
